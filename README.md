### Prerequisites

Prerequisites, HPM 881 and 882; permission of the instructor for students lacking the prerequisites.

### Preparing for the course

You will need R for this course. You will need to download and install 
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Anaconda or Miniconda**: [Install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- **VS Code**: [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Quarto**: [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- **R**: [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
-  on your computer.  

**Detailed instructions can also be found [here](https://hpm883.github.io/instructions) for installing the tools you need and working with the lab materials.**

If you are not already familiar with R, we strongly encourage you to attempt to become familiar before the start of the course.  That way, you will spend much less time become familiar with the tools, and be able to focus more on the methods.  The following links provide basic introductions to R, which you can study at your own pace before the course begins.

* [*An Introduction to R*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf).
* Data Camp [R tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).
* Data Camp [R Markdown tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown), first chapter.
* [R Codeschool](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).

We also strongly recommend you spend some time before the course working through the following materials:

* Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (2016) _R for Data Science_, O'Reilly Media. Note: Online version is available from the authors' page [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).


### Important Specifics

#### Lab exercise

Computer-based exercises will feature prominently in the course, especially in the lab sessions.  The use of all software tools will be explained in the sessions, including how to download and install them.  All of the class work will be done using R, using publicly available packages.

#### Main Textbook

The primary textbooks are:

* Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (2016) _R for Data Science_, O'Reilly Media. Note: Online version is available from the authors' page [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).
